TODO:

[ ] conference and team preference
[ ] college football just saturday

[ ] have payment submission be the first step, have it create a raw pick that you can edit and submit, status -> requested --> paid --> submitted 
    [ ] allow admin to mark requested picks as paid (see above)
[ ] fix shimmer on iOS

[ ] getUser doesn't work, might have to replace with session auth()

[x] Feature: be able to create driver from starting lineup form --> tested and working
[x] HardChargerTable Calculations
[x] Need to test and debug score calculation
[ ] Better user instructions if pick form is submitted and has error --> how to fix the form
[ ] be able to delete items from collection
[x] BUG: when creating a new race and then adding racers, the transfer drivers are not autopopulating correctly (maybe an extra +1 is added to index?)
[ ] update races for mid-race and end of race finishing list (update current_position or racers of race id)
[t] pick score calculation
[x] hard charger leaderboard table
[t] add guess prediction to hard charger form
[ ] race page needs to be organized to help create the lineup or update lineup during race and change status of race.
[ ] need to filter list of races when one is selected so that duplicates can't be selected, or show warning.
[ ] see if server action for getCurrentPlayer is producing the clerkMiddleware warning, could also be checkRole()5
[ ] GameDetails used for creating picks and also explaining game on [gameId] page
[t] server actions get getPicksWithGamesByPlayerId and getPicksByPlayerIdAndGameStatus

[ ] admin screen for modifying payments
[ ] create classic draw name from hat game
[ ] incorporate tie breaker type into game
[ ] user gaining access to private games (like a join game for ncaa tourney)
[ ] handle converting getPlayer and other server actions to convert private_games id's back and forth from string to ObjectId
[ ] create player in middleware

[x] nav bar at top
[ ] See how many users can register before clerk will bitch about me not paying --> then bang head on desk very hard
[ ] Clerk production/deployment steps (very involved and requires custom domain)

IDEAS FOR ANIMATION:
- screen brightness sweeps from bottom to top (like when i plug in pixel 6a into charger)
- press and hold to submit pick, charging animation like soda machine at boston amazon
- rim of card in looping until you fill out all the info on that card
- submit can involve dragging a piece of paper out of a hat

[x] Debug CreateGameForm submission
[x] Event Form
[x] Game Form
