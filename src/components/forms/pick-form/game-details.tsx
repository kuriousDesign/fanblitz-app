// Hard Charger
// -1 point for every car passed, or one point added for every car that passes them. If you choose a driver outside of the A main, their hard charger score for each race will accumulate for the final score.
// Example: 
// David Gravel starts 6th in the B Main, finishes 3rd and transfer to A. That's -3 points from the B. In the A main he starts 19th and finishes in 12th, that's -7 points from the A. The total score is -10 points.

// Additionally, choose the finishing position of the hard charger. The difference between their actual position and predicted position will be added (penalized) to your score.

// Example, you predicted Schatz to be your hard charger and predicted that he would finish in 7th but he actually finished in 5th. You would be penalized 2 points. Same thing if he actually finished in 9th.

// If you choose a B main driver as your hard charger, you get the points from their B main race as well as points from the A. However, if the B main driver does not transfer to the A, no points will be rewarded to you.
