      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Hard Charger scoring is based on a wager (prediction) of how many cars you think the driver will pass and their actual performance. If they exceed your prediction, you only get the points you predicted. If they pass fewer cars, a penalty is applied to the points they earned you. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    
        You will select {game.num_hard_chargers} drivers and predict how many cars they will pass over the course of the night. Races included as follows: {includedRacesBlurb}.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each driver can earn you points or lose you points, depending on if they passed more cars than passed them for the night.
        <br />
        Driver scores are added together to give your total &quot;hard charger&quot; score.
      </p>

            <p className="text-purple-600 mt-4">
        The scoring system incentivizes accurate or slightly conservative predictions over ambitious ones, with perfect accuracy or being the optimal strategy.

            <strong>Cars Passed Calculation for Multiple Races</strong> 
            <br />
            The number of cars passed in a single race is calculated by subtracting the finishing position from the starting position.

            <code className='text-orange-600'> CarsPassedInRace = StartingPosition - FinalPosition</code>
            <br />
            <br />
            The total number of cars passed is the sum of cars passed from  all included races: {includedRacesBlurb}.
            <br />
            <code className='text-orange-600'> TotalCarsPassed = CarsPassedInRace1 + CarsPassedInRace2 ... </code>
